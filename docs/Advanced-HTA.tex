Bringing a new health technology to market and into the hands of a patient is a long process. Most of the times patients, who have a medical need, ask themselves why does it take so long to make the health technology available to everyone. When a health technology is in the market, it usually took between 5 to 10 years to make
it available.

Depending on the country, governments usually are involved in the reimbursement process. They usually ask the next questions when a new health technology is available:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How much does it cost?
\item
  Will it save lives and/or improve quality of life?
\item
  Do we have enough budget to fund it?
\item
  If we have a pool of interventions for a specific disease, which one/ones should we reimburse?
\end{itemize}

Moreover, physicians, patients, insurance plans, and advocacy groups play an important role when new technologies are available in the market (why?). Even though a new technology see the light (i.e.~it has proved to be safe and effective), insurance providers or the government will not necessarily cover it. Usually they argue that the new technology is ``Not cost-effective'' or ``Not have good value for money''. \emph{These notes aim to provide all the necessary tools to decide if a new intervention has a good value-for-money.} It is important to stress that value-for-money decision is only one of many questions that are asked by one of the users of a \textbf{health technology assessment (HTA)}: patients, healthcare workers, government, and others.

\item
  Inappropriate comparator. Lack of proper statistical analysis.
\item

The use of open-source programming languages, such as \texttt{R}, in health decision sciences is growing and has the potential to facilitate model transparency, reproducibility, and shareability. However, realizing this potential can be challenging. Models are complex and primarily built to answer a research question, with model sharing and transparency relegated to being secondary goals. Moreover, many decision modelers are not formally trained in computer programming and may lack good coding practices, further compounding the problem of model transparency. \textbf{Therefore, throughout this course, the programming language \texttt{R} will be used to show its potential for advanced modelling in the context of HTA.}

For this course, we will be using the book \href{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/}{``R for Data Science''}. To install \texttt{R} and \texttt{Rstudio}, instructions are provided in Chapter 1 of this book. We will also use Excel throughout this course.

The final deliverable for this course is a mini-HTA on a medical technology (preferably something topical), with a focus on the quantitative aspect of it. Given that the translation of a health policy question into a relevant research question is an essential first step in the conduct of HTA, students are required to formulate a research question and submit for grading purposes. This should include at leas some of the following: an overview of the technology being assessed; a clear specification of the policy problem; and the research question(s) (including PICO) with objectives.

\section{Definition and rationale}\label{definition-and-rationale}}

The first thing that we need to know is the definition of a \textbf{health technology}. A health technology is any intervention that may be used to promote health, to prevent, diagnose or treat disease or for rehabilitation or long-term care.

\textbf{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  List some examples of health technologies.
\end{enumerate}

Depending on the agency, health technology assessment has a broad spectrum of definitions:

\emph{``HTA is a multidisciplinary process that uses explicit methods to determine the value of a health technology at different points in its lifecycle. The purpose is to inform decision-making in order to promote an equitable, efficient, and high-quality health system.'' \href{https://www.inahta.org/}{INAHTA}}

\emph{``Health technology assessment is a multidisciplinary process that uses explicit methods to determine the value of a health technology at different points in its lifecycle. The purpose is to inform decision-making in order to promote an equitable, efficient, and high-quality health system.'' \href{https://www.eunethta.eu/}{EUnetHTA}}

\emph{``A comprehensive, objective, evidence-based analysis of the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and broader impact of drugs, medical technologies and health systems. HTA examines technologies at all stages of their life cycle, from development through to maturity and obsolescence.'' \href{https://www.cadth.ca}{CADTH}}

The purpose of HTA is to support/help decision makers by identifying technologies that will improve health outcomes and deliver value for every dollar invested.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Does a new health technology offer a clinical advantage over the alternatives/standard approaches?
\item
  Is it worth the investment?
\item
  Can I pay for it?
\item
  Who would benefit from it?
\item
  Any ethical, social or legal issues
\end{itemize}

But, what are the reasons for conducting HTAs?

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Increased demand for healthcare (why?)
\item
  Soaring healthcare costs
\item
  Increased rate of diffusion of new technologies and associated evidence
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{economic-evaluation-1}{%
\section{Economic evaluation}\label{economic-evaluation-1}}

Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-utility analysis (CUA) have been proposed as methods for comparing alternative uses of scarce health-care resources. The difference between CEA and CUA lies in the way outputs are measured.

We can find different objectives of CEA across the literature:

\emph{``The underlying premise of cost-effectiveness analysis in health problems is that for any given level of resources available, society (or the decision making jurisdiction involved) wishes to maximize the total aggregate health benefits conferred''} \citet{weinstein1977foundations}.

\emph{``For any given rate of output {[}the combination of inputs{]} . that costs the decision maker least''} \citet{culyer1980political}

\emph{``A method of determining the most efficient way of dealing with a specified health problem''} \citet{green1988priority}

The goal of CEA is to maximize health benefits produced from a given level of resources. Therefore, it is consistent with welfare economics concept of Pareto efficiency \citep{birch1992cost} (Figure \ref{fig:fig1}).

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=11.58in]{images/fig1} 

}

\caption{Production possibilities frontier}\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

In practice, CEA \textbf{relaxes the constraint on available resources}. Because the focus of the evaluation is not a fixed resource pool, but a specific programme making demands on resources, the comparison of the programme under evaluation with an existing programme (e.g., services aimed at improving FS) must consider not only the inter-programme differences in outputs (incremental benefits), but also the inter-programme differences in resources used (incremental costs).

\citet{weinstein1977foundations} state that: \emph{``the criterion for cost-effectiveness is the ratio of the net increase of health-care costs to the net effectiveness. The lower the value of this ratio, the higher the priority in terms of maximizing benefits derived from a given health expenditure''}. Issue is that applying a ratio does nod lead to the maximization of benefits from a fixed resource pool (movement from A to C in Figure). \textbf{The real problem of the application of CEA is the failure to adhere strictly to the notion of opportunity cost in the measurement of the (incremental) cost of a programme.} The existing programme represents a true opportunity cost for the entire resource requirements of the new programme, even though it does not absorb this level of resources.

\hypertarget{cost-effectiveness-in-practice}{%
\subsection{Cost-effectiveness in practice}\label{cost-effectiveness-in-practice}}

As mentioned before, CEA include both costs and effects, which are represented graphically in a plane:

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=12.31in]{images/fig2} 

}

\caption{Incremental CE plane}\label{fig:fig2}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Describe the plane.
\item
  What is the willingness-to-pay in this plane?
\item
  What type of uncertainties are encountered in this plane?
\end{enumerate}

Why incremental? We can see it using the example from \citet{gray2011applied} applied to mutually exclusive options (see Figure \ref{fig:fig3}):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Diet and excercise (C): Reference
\item
  Metformin (A): \$500k/250 life-years
\item
  New drug (B): \$2500k/300 life-years
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}

{\centering \includegraphics[width=9.25in]{images/fig3} 

}

\caption{Average and incremental cost-effectivenessr}\label{fig:fig3}
\end{figure}

Clearly, as this example shows, it is quite misleading to calculate average cost-effectiveness ratios, as they ignore the alternatives available.

\textbf{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the difference between average cost-effectiveness ratios vs incremental?
\end{enumerate}

The idea of CEA is to maximize health benefits with the available resources, which in terms of the CE plane represents pushing as far to the right as possible while moving up the vertical axis as little as possible. The next example from \citet{gray2011applied} shows the ideas behind \textbf{cost-effectivness frontier, dominance, extended dominance} (Table \ref{tab:table2}).

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:table2}Calculating incremental cost-effectiveness}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r|r|r|r|r}
\hline
Option & Cost & QALYs & Incremental cost & Incremental QALY & ICER\\
\hline
A & 0 &  &  &  & \\
\hline
B & 10,000 & 0.40 & 10,000 & 0.40 & 25,000\\
\hline
C & 22,000 & 0.55 & 12,000 & 0.15 & 80,000\\
\hline
D & 25,000 & 0.50 & 3,000 & -0.05 & -60,000\\
\hline
E & 40,000 & 1.00 & 15,000 & 0.50 & 30,000\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Once we have the ICERs for different independent programmes. How can we maximize health gains with this information? Note that now we are comparing different programmes as opposed to mutually exclusive options. Let's work in the next example:

\begin{table}

\caption{\label{tab:table3}Using cost-effectiveness to maximize health gain}
\centering
\begin{tabular}[t]{l|r|r|r}
\hline
Intervention & Incremental cost (per k) & Incremental QALYs & ICER\\
\hline
1 & 1,300 & 165 & 7,879\\
\hline
2 & 600 & 28 & 21,429\\
\hline
3 & 750 & 110 & 6,818\\
\hline
4 & 750 & 13 & 57,692\\
\hline
5 & 2,200 & 75 & 29,333\\
\hline
6 & 400 & 85 & 4,706\\
\hline
Total & 6,000 & 476 & \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Finally, we can ask ourselves. What is the maximum value of the incremental cost-effectivess ratio (\(\lambda\))?

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Rule-based approaches - Adopting arbitrary thresholds. For example, \citet{laupacis1992attractive} adopted identical cut-off points of CAN\$20,000 per QALY gained, up to which level they considered that there would be strong grounds for adoption, and CAN\$100,000 per QALY gained, above which they considered that evidence for adoption was weak. An alternative approach is to use the country's gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. \citet{williams2004could} advanced one line of reasoning in support of this, arguing that each
  person has an entitlement to a `fair share' of the country's wealth.
\item
  League table approach - If we had full information on the ICERs of all available interventions, it would be possible to rank them by ICER. See the example in Table \ref{tab:table2}.
\end{itemize}

What are the issues with these approaches?

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\lambda\) is a function of the budget. Therefore it is constantly changing
\item
  The dynamic nature of \(\lambda\). As new programs are funded and others replaced, the identification of the last program funded changes.

\subsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Irrespective of whether the problem face by decision-makers is simple (maximizing health gains from available resources) or complex (subject to considerations of equity, accessibility, etc.), if it is not to be considered in the context of a resource constraint there is little use for economics in the way the problem is considered.
\item
  Other approaches have been considered, such as methods in linear programming, which is consistent with the objective of CEA.
\end{itemize}

\[
\max_{x_i,\dots,x_n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_iE_i\\
\text{s.t.}\ \ \ \ \ \sum_{i=1}^n x_ic_i\leq C
\]

where \(x_i\) is the health intervention presented as a binary outcome (1 or 0), \(E_i\) is the present value of the health benefits (measured using QALYs) generated by programme over the planning period, and \(c_i\) is the present value of the cost of providing programme \(i\) over the planning period.

\section{Decision modelling}\label{decision-modelling}}

HTA is undertaken in order to inform decision-making regarding the appropriate use of particular healthcare programs and interventions, and involves the synthesis of a range of evidence. Broadly speaking, this implies two important components of this process:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Gathering evidence for the disease and technology of concern from a range of primary studies. This includes effectiveness, costs, epidemiology, natural history of the disease, quality of life, etc.
\item
  Synthesizing the evidence found in the first component in order to inform policy and decision-making.
\end{enumerate}

Because of the nature of these two components, decision-analytic modelling has played an important role in HTA. This is because it represents an explicit approach to synthesizing currently available evidence regarding the effectiveness and costs of alternative (mutually exclusive) healthcare strategies \citep{philips2006good}. Therefore one of the main objectives of decision-analytic modelling is to address the relationship between the effectiveness and costs of alternative healthcare strategies in order to assess relative cost-effectiveness (CE) and to determine which options should be adopted given existing information \citep{philips2006good}. Consequently, modelling in the context of HTA is a typical problem of decision-making under uncertainty.

Traditionally randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have been a key component of many HTA process. This is because randomsation protects against selection bias and confounding. Nevertheless, the information produced by RCTs can be limited with respect to evaluating health care as delivered in the real world. This can be because:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Not all interventions to be compared are included in the trial.
\item
  Not enough follow-up.
\item
  Not enough flexibility (controlled trial).
\item
  Small sample sizes.
\item
  Patients in trial are not representative to the target population.
\end{enumerate}

Consequently, it is advised that HTA submissions incorporate information from as many sources as possible to address some of these problems \citep{sculpher2006whither}. As mentioned before, decision analytical models allow for the synthesis of information across multiple sources and for the comparison of multiple options that might not have been included as part of an RCT.

Briefly, \citet{dahabreh2016guidance} consider some potential goals of modelling in a health-care context:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To structure investigators' thinking and to facilitate the communication of data, assumptions, and results.
\item
  To synthesize data from disparate sources.
\item
  To make predictions.
\item
  To support causal explanations.
\item
  To inform decision making.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, they also distinguish different stages for the development of a decision analytic model

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Define a question
\item
  Decide on the type of decision model most appropriate
\item
  Conceptualize the model (and its mathematical structure).
\item
  Gather all the evidence required for the model and synthesize it.
\item
  Implement and run the model.
\item
  Assess the model.
\end{enumerate}

The development of models, especially those trying to explain complex phenoma and informing difficult decisions, is a demanding task. Choosing between alternative modeling approaches can be difficult because the correct choice would not be obvious at early stages in developing a decision analytical model. In general, modelling is most useful when data have limitations (e.g.~non-randomised evidence, sparse evidence, etc.), when the research question is complex and when choices are preference laden \citep{dahabreh2016guidance}. Another important aspect when choosing between modelling approaches is whether the model in question is likely to show results that the intended audience will consider credible and useful. Multiple iterations are typically needed between the key activities outlined previously because at each activity the need for changes at earlier stages may become evident.

\subsection{Importance of decision-analytic models in HTA}\label{importance-of-decision-analytic-models-in-hta}}

When doing a cost-effectiveness analysis in the context of HTA, one usually starts conceptualizing the model that will help answer the research question. But what is a model? A model a simplified representation of reality \citep{roberts2012conceptualizing}, where inputs from different sources inform it and its purpose, in the context of HTA, is to inform medical decisions and health-related resource allocation questions \citep{roberts2012conceptualizing}.

Methods for the conduct of decision-analytic modelling have continued evolving to address the ever-increasing information needs of decision makers. The complexity and continued advances of the relevant methods have spurred the publication of recommendation statements on ``best practices'' for modeling in the context of HTA \citep{roberts2012conceptualizing, briggs2012model}. Some of these modelling techniques \citep{caro2012modeling} include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Decision-tree models.
\item
  State-transition models.
\item
  Micro-simulation models.
\item
  Discrete event simulation (DES) models.
\item
  Dynamic transmission models.
\end{itemize}
