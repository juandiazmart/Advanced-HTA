Chapters 1 and 2 of *R for data science*.

## Definition and rationale

The first thing that we need to know is the definition of a **health technology**. A health technology is any intervention that may be used to promote health, to prevent, diagnose or treat disease or for rehabilitation or long-term care.

**Questions**

1. List some examples of health technologies.

Depending on the agency, health technology assessment has a broad spectrum of definitions:

*"HTA is a multidisciplinary process that uses explicit methods to determine the value of a health technology at different points in its lifecycle. The purpose is to inform decision-making in order to promote an equitable, efficient, and high-quality health system." [INAHTA](https://www.inahta.org/)*

*"Health technology assessment is a multidisciplinary process that uses explicit methods to determine the value of a health technology at different points in its lifecycle. The purpose is to inform decision-making in order to promote an equitable, efficient, and high-quality health system." [EUnetHTA](https://www.eunethta.eu/)*

*"A comprehensive, objective, evidence-based analysis of the  clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and broader impact  of drugs,  medical technologies and health systems. HTA examines technologies  at all stages of their life cycle, from development  through to maturity and obsolescence." [CADTH](https://www.cadth.ca)*

The purpose of HTA is to support/help decision makers by identifying technologies that will improve health outcomes and  deliver value for every dollar invested.

+ Does a new health technology offer a clinical  advantage over the alternatives/standard approaches?
+ Is it worth the investment?
+ Can I pay for it?
+ Who would benefit from it?
+ Any ethical, social or legal issues

But, what are the reasons for conducting HTAs?

+ Increased demand for healthcare (why?)
+ Soaring healthcare costs
+ Increased rate of diffusion of new technologies and associated evidence

Once we have seen the definition and rationale for conducting HTAs, it is important to talk about the potential users.

+ Government
+ Managers in hospitals
+ Healthcare workers
+ Researchers

## HTA process

1. Identification and prioritization of technologies
2. Clear specification of the problem
3. Technology assessment and review
    + Evidence and systematic literature review
    + Aggregation and appraisal  of evidence
    + Synthesize and consolidate
    + Collect primary data (if necessary)
    + Economic evaluation, budget and health system impact
    + Assessment of social, legal, and ethical consideration
    + Formulation of finding
4. Dissemination and implementation of recommendations
5. Monitor the impact of assessment reports

### Identification and prioritization of technologies

+ Drugs seeking public or private reimbursement
+ Variable for non-drug technologies. However candidates:
  + High potential to improve health outcomes, reduce harm or decrease costs with similar efficacy
  + Large numbers of individuals affected
  + Political pressure
  + Unmet needsâ€”no current treatment

### Clear specification of the problem

+ Problem statements need to consider:
  + Patient population affected (indication; epidemiology)
  + Intervention being considered (drug, device, new/old)
  + Comparators
  + Outcome(s) or interest
  + Setting (e.g. hospital, community)
+ Well formulated question

### Technology assessment and review

#### Evidence and systematic literature review

+ A comprehensive search of the literature based on systematic methods is essential
+ 2 main types of resources relevant to HTA:
  + Published literature
  + Grey literature
  
#### Identification, aggregation &  appraisal of evidence 

+ Objective, systematic process for screening and  determine studies to be included in the synthesis
+ Classify the studies
  + Randomised, non-randomised and economic
+ Critical appraisal of the quality of the evidence


####  Synthesize & consolidate

+ Findings from multiple studies often combined to respond to the HTA question
+ Techniques commonly used to synthesize data in HTA are:
  + Meta-analysis, meta-regression
  + Network meta-analysis
  
####  Economic evaluation

+  Measures the incremental costs and benefits of the technology under review compared to one or more relevant technologies
+ CEA, CUA and CBA
+ Budget impact
  
#### Assessment of social, legal & ethical considerations

+ Example: genetic information (why?)
+ Any access or equity issues following the dissemination and implementation of technologies?

#### Formulation of findings

+ Explicitly link quality of the evidence to the  strength of findings and recommendations as well as any limitations
+ Recommendations based on the findings that reflect the original question(s)

### Dissemination of recommendations

+ Findings translated into relevant and understandable information
+ Knowledge translation

### Monitoring the impact of reports

+ Some recommendations are translated into policies with clear and quantifiable impacts (e.g. adoption of new technology, change in reimbursement)
+ Others go ignored and are not readily adopted into general practice

## Excercises

Read the following [HTA](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta503/) published by NICE in the UK. Do the following:

+ What is the population?
+ What is the intervention and comparators?
+ Is there a reproducible search strategy for the clinical evidence in the HTA?
+ Was the clinical evidence critically appraised? How?
+ Describe the evidence synthesis process
+ What type of economic evaluation they used?
+ What type of model was used in the economic evaluation?
+ How was the uncertainty handled in the economic evaluation?
+ Is there a budget impact in the HTA?
+ What is the recommendation?
